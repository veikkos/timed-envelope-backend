# Timed Envelope Backend

To-be Timed Envelope application backend. The idea of the "service" is that one can create encrypted message which are only decryptable in the future starting on certain date. The backend will provide RSA public keys for each (future) date to encrypt messages, and backend will provide RSA private keys for decryption for past dates.
